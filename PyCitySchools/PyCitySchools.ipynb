    "In the PyCity School District, charter schools are clearly out performing the district schools in both reading and math. These schools are all smaller than the district schools, but actually spend less per student than the larger district schools. Additional analysis would be needed to determine if the relationship between size and/or school type is actually driving the better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, charter schools have fairly close score averages and passing percentages between reading and math, while the district schools all have significantly lower scores and percent of students passing math. Reading score averages are much closer between the school types, though district schools still have noticeably less students passing reading than charter schools."
